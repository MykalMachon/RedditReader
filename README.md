Reddit Reader is a simple text to speech (tts) application that allows you to have your browser read you reddit posts. You do this by looking up your favourite subreddits and then selecting an post that interests you.

## Inspiration

This application was inspired by those TikTok videos a TTS bot reads popular reddit posts and overlays the audio on recorded gameplay.

## Contributing

If you have an idea for a feature, or have something you think may improve the repo feel free to make an issue, or submit a PR. I can't gaurantee I'll merge PR's for unagreed upon features, so I would suggest opening an issue first so we can talk through the idea.
